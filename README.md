# eHacking Installation Script using ansible

This repository is meant to transform a basic Ubuntu system into a hacking platform. Previously, we used to deploy a Virtualbox image, but with the rise of different architectures, such as aarch64 (MacBook Silicon), and the variety of hypervisors, this was becoming a tough task.

The idea of this project is to transform a clean installation on any hypervisor into a hacking platform. All necessary software will be automatically deployed and installed using Ansible.
